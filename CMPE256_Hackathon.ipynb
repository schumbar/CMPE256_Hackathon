            "I rise to present the first Budget of a free and independent India. This occasion\n",
            "may well be considered an historic one and I count it a rare privilege that it has fallento me to be the Finance Minister to present this Budget. While I am conscious of thehonour that is implied in this position, I am even more conscious of the responsibilitiesthat face the custodian of the finances of India at this critical juncture. I have no doubtthat in the discharge of my responsibilities I may count on the sympathetic andwholehearted co-operation of every Hon’ble Member in this House.\n",
            "2. It is not necessary to dwell at any length on the political developments\n",
            "which have led to the momentous changes that have taken place since the Budget forthe current year was presented to the Legislative Assembly last February. The partitionof the country has cut across its economic and cultural unity and the growth of centuriesof common life to which all the communities have contributed. The long-term effectsof the division of the country still remain to be assessed and we are too near the eventsto take a dispassionate view. When the ashes of controversy have died down, it will befor the future historian to judge the wisdom of the step and its consequences on thedestiny of one fifth of the human race. Whatever might be the immediate politicaljustification of partition, its economic consequences must be fully appreciated if thetwo Dominions are to safeguard the interests of the ordinary man in both the newStates. Regions which have functioned for centuries on a complementary basis havebeen suddenly cut asunder. To have had as a single economic unit a subcontinentpeopled by a fifth of the human race meant by itself a great advantage for the teemingmillions of its population an advantage not fully realised, and perhaps not properlyutilized while the unity was a fact. While it may be a comparatively easy matter tomake the necessary political adjustments resulting from partition, it would requiretime, patience, goodwill and mutual understanding to effect the adjustments necessitatedby the economic consequences of partition. Economically India and Pakistan haveeach points of advantages and disadvantages. In general, it may be said that, whileIndia is much the stronger at present in industrial production and mineral resources,Pakistan has some advantage in agricultural resources, especially foodstuffs. But thecomplementary character of their economies is even deeper than is indicated by thisgeneralisation. The compelling forces of economic necessity must create a friendlyand cooperative spirit between the two Dominions and I trust that, when the presentpassions subside and normal conditions of life return, our people will work together tosecure that, notwithstanding the political division, the economic life of the commonman is not injured. So far as we are concerned, the Indian Union with its populationof nearly 300 millions will be the second largest country in the world next to China.2Our economy is more balanced than that of most countries and, in spite of the setbacks\n",

As soon as the decision to divide the countrywas taken, a Partition Council, consisting of the representatives of both the futureGovernments, was set up to implement the decision. A number of Expert Committees,on which both the future Governments were equally represented, were appointed underthe aegis of the Partition Council to work out the administrative and other consequencesof the partition. These Committees, some of which are assisted by a number ofdepartmental subcommittees, dealt with all aspects of the problems arising out of thepartition such as the transfer of staff and organisations, the division of assets andliabilities, the arrangements for the coinage and currency In the two Dominions, thetrade and economic relations between them, the continuance of economic controls andso on.

Thousands of innocent lives have been lost in the two Dominions andmigration on a scale unprecedented in history has taken place. The total number ofpeople involved in this mass migration of population has reached colossal figures oneither side giving rise to problems of great magnitude affecting the economy of thecountry. The Immediate effect of these tragic developments has been to divert theattention of the Government almost completely from normal activities. There has beenan almost total breakdown of the economy of the East and West Punjabs. WhileGovernment have done and are doing everything possible to relieve the immediatedistress and suffering of the refugees, the formulation of long-range plans for theirrehabilitation raises formidable issues both in the financial and administrative fields.These problems have imposed a heavy burden on the Central exchequer, the magnitudeof which it is not possible to assess at present. The budget of the Central Governmentfor the next few years will be materially affected by this unexpected development inthe country, Our whole programme of post-war development will have to be reviewedin the light of this context.\n",

Daring the current year from Aprilto September we have already imported 10.62 lakhs of tons of foodgrains at a cost ofover 42 crores of rupees.

The implementation ofthis policy must largely depend on the Provincial Governments though the Governmentof India has been and will always be prepared to afford all possible help In thisdirection.

            "major problem has been that of keeping the inflationary trends under control. It is notnecessary for me to dilate on the causes of the emergence of these trends, since the endof the war. While as a result of the war the purchasing power in the hands of thecommunity increased considerably, the available supply of commodities in the post-war period was not sufficient to meet the increasing demand for them. The shortage ofessential commodities, particularly food and clothing, aggravated the situation owingto the rise in the money income of some sections of the community who in the pastnever competed for food and consumer goods on the same scale. Difficulties in transportand distribution accentuated the shortages while the partition last year and the economicdislocation caused over considerable parts of the country by the movement of populationbetween the two Dominions made the position worse.

In thematter of food the supply position still continues to be difficult and last year owing tothe poor crops in certain parts of the country we have had to import 2.8 million tonsfrom overseas at a cost of Rs. 130 crores against an estimated import of 2 million tonsat a cost of Rs. 110 crores. The position is expected to be still more difficult this yearowing to the floods in Bihar and the United Provinces, the damage caused by the recentcyclone in Bombay and the outbreak of famine in parts of Gujarat, Saurashtra, Rajasthanand Cutch and imports may amount to 4 million tons. As the House is aware, it hasalready been decided to reintroduce food control and it is hoped that this will secure anequitable supply of food grains throughout the country at fair prices. In respect of othercommodities the position in regard to internal production has, I am glad to say, beenencouraging in recent months although it has not been possible in many cases to reachthe peak production of the war years or the target that has been set. Last year theproduction of coal at 29.73 million tons and of steel at 854,000 tons just fell short of theproduction in the previous year while the production of salt rose from 49.6 millionmaunds to 59.3 million maunds, of cotton yarn from 1,315 million lbs. to 1,442 millionlbs., of cloth from 3,816 million yards to 4,338 million yards, of art silk fabrics from 85million yards to 114 million yards, of plywood from 28.6 million sq. feet to 38.63million sq. feet and of soap from 80,000 tons to 190,000 tons. The flow of raw materialsto industry has also improved with the improvement in the transport position whilewith the relaxation of import controls there has been a larger flow of imported goods.Production has been greatly assisted by the occurrence of fewer strikes and labourdisputes. If the present favourable trends in production continue, I have no doubt that itwill  be  possible  not  merely  to arrest the rise of prices but to bring them downgradually.\n",

While there is obviously a large amount of money in thecountry competing for the limited supply of goods, the Investment market has beenstagnant and there has been little flow of money into Government loans or into industrialconcerns. This stagnation is due In large measure to the prevailing uncertainty in regardto matters affecting industrial development and prospects. My own view is that withthe huge potential demand in this country for both consumer and capital goods, there isbound to be for many years a wide field for private enterprise and that in this matter noone who invests money is taking a greater risk than in any other country in the world.\n",

            "prevent, as far as possible, the further creation of purchasing power in the hands of thecommunity and to take all steps possible to stimulate production and Instil a spirit ofconfidence in industry. With this end In view, in the field of taxation additional dutieson certain articles of luxury such as liquor, tobacco, motor cars, silk and art silk fabricswere imposed and an excise duty on superfine cloth was levied. Power was taken tomake provisional assessments of income tax on the basis of returns submitted by theassessees. A system of interest bearing deposits for income tax introduced in 1943 wasalso revived and It was decided to postpone for a further period of three years therefund of deposits of Excess Profits Tax except for approved purposes. A temporarylimit was also placed on the amount that may be distributed as dividend by publiccompanies, by an Ordinance, the enactment of which into law is now under considerationby the House. Among measures taken to stimulate industrial production, I would mentionthe reduction in the import duty on machinery and certain industrial raw materials andthe abolition of the import duty on cotton yarn. New industrial undertakings commencingproduction in the next three years have been given exemption from income tax for thefirst five years up to a limit of six per cent per annum on their capital. The rules regulatingdepreciation allowances have also been liberalised. In the field of Governmentalexpenditure a rapid review was conducted of all capital and development schemesincluding the Provincial schemes. As a result the total provision for capital anddevelopment schemes and loans has been substantially reduced. It was also made clearto the Provinces that in the present financial situation they should not count on Centralassistance for implementing their schemes of social or agrarian reform. The House willrealise that it was not without regret that we decided to hold up even temporarily thevarious schemes of development the execution of which is necessary for the well beingof the country.

This reduction was due mainly to the largeimports of food but there were also substantial imports of other goods in satisfaction ofthe pent-up demand of the war years and a certain amount of repatriation of Britishcapital. During 1947-48 the reduction was somewhat smaller due to the restrictive importpolicy which was introduced towards the close of 1947 and the balances fell by only4Rs. 67 crores to Rs. 1,545 crores. In the first ten months of the current year there has\n",
            "been a further drop of Rs. 556 crores in these balances. This heavy outgo is due toseveral causes.

After the war,the trend of trade rapidly reversed itself and, in common with the rest of the world, thiscountry started having substantial deficits on hard currency account. The reason forthis was that we had increasingly to turn to the hard currency countries for ourrequirements as the countries whose economies had been disrupted by the war couldnot meet them.

            "17. The increase of Rs. 48.14 crores in civil expenditure is mainly due to three\n",
            "causes. Firstly, the revised estimates include a new provision of Rs. 20.75 crores formeeting pre-partition liabilities for which no provision was made in the budget. At thetime the budget was framed, sufficient data regarding the outstanding liabilities werenot available and the arrangements with Pakistan for meeting and adjusting these hadnot also been settled. It was hoped that these liabilities would be met and shared currentlyby the two Dominions but the Pakistan Government declined to meet these liabilitieson the ground that they were initially those of India and that Pakistan would take itsshare only through the debt settlement. The Government of India do not accept thisview as, in their opinion, after the division of the available cash balances of the undividedGovernment between the two Governments, the outstanding liabilities should be paidand currently shared by the two Governments. But in order to avoid hardship to thosewho had made supplies or rendered services to the undivided Government, theGovernment of India have agreed to meet the liabilities in the first instance. Certainoutstanding payments relating to the pre-partition period such as the Provincial share ofIncome-tax, are also due to the Provincial Governments now located In India which theGovernment of India propose to meet. Secondly, the expenditure on the relief andrehabilitation of refugees which has always been difficult to estimate and for which aprovision of Rs. 10.04 crores was made in the budget is now expected to amount to Rs.19.45 crores. This increase is partly due to the carryover of certain liabilities from theprevious year, mainly payments to Provincial Governments, which could not be madebefore the close of last year and partly to increased expenditure on relief which has tobe regulated with reference to the constantly changing requirements of the situation.Thirdly, the expenditure on the subsidising of imported food grains and the payment ofbonuses to Provincial Governments on internal procurement is now expected to exceedthe original budget by Rs. 12.05 crores.

On a study of the working of the income tax law and its administrationduring recent years, the Commission came to the conclusion that on a long term viewthe first task was no less important than the second, and as work on the second had forvarious reasons necessarily to be slow, the Commission devoted a great part of its timetill recently to the first task. This involved the examination of voluminous evidencetendered in reply to a comprehensive questionnaire which was issued and the Commissionhas recently submitted a long report in which it has made recommendations on manypoints of law and of administration.

            "the Commission has completed a few cases. Greater progress was not possible for avariety of reasons. Firstly, it was only In April 1948 that the necessary staff forinvestigation work could be placed at the disposal of the Commission. This was becauseit was not possible for the Income-tax Department to spare their more experiencedofficers for this work before April 1948, In view of the shortage of officers in theDepartment and the large amount of arrears that had to be cleared. However, this difficultyhas now been overcome to some extent, and the officers authorised by the Commissionare working in different cities carrying on investigation under instructions and directionsgiven by the Commission.

In a democratic society it could not be otherwise. What can we learnfrom this debate? The most important thing that comes out clearly is that wecannot realise our goal of establishing a just society, if we abandon the planningprocess. But India’s future development depends crucially on how well the planningprocess is adapted to the needs of a fast changing situation. I believe that withoutan intelligent and systematic coordinated resource use in some major sectors ofour economy, development will be lopsided. It will violate deeply cherished valuesof equity and it will keep India well below its social, intellectual and moral potential.But our planning processes must be sensitive to the needs of a dynamic economy.Over centralisation and excessive bureaucratisation of economic processes haveproved to be counter productive. We need to expand the scope and the area for theoperation of market forces. A reformed price system can be a superior instrumentof resource allocation than quantitative controls. But markets can only serve thosewho are part of the market system. A vast number of people in our country live onthe edges of a subsistence economy.

            "the Industrial Revolution in the western world concentrated on the creation ofwealth, unmindful of the social misery and inequity which characterised this process.The democratisation of the polity came much later. The socialist experiment incharting a new path for accelerated industrial transformation of an underdevelopedeconomy and polity did achieve considerable success in developing technologicaland military capabilities, accumulation of capital for rapid industrial growth andhuman resources development, in countries such as the USSR. But recentdevelopments have shown that this approach too suffered from major weaknesses,particularly in its allocative efficiency, in the management of technical change,control of environmental degradation and in harnessing the vast latent energy andtalents of individuals. In India, we launched an experiment under the leadership ofPandit Jawaharlal Nehru, an experiment which sought to unite the strengths andmerits of different approaches to accelerated development of our backward economy.We have achieved considerable success in the field of development, modernisationand greater social equity. However, we are yet far from realising our full potentialin all these areas. We have to accomplish the unfinished task, while remainingsteadfast in our allegiance to the values of a democratic system.\n",

At the same time, we haveto develop a new attitude towards wealth. In the ultimate analysis, all wealth is asocial product. Those who create it and own it, have to hold it as a trust and useit in the interest of the society, and particularly of those who are under-privilegedand without means. Years ago, Gandhiji expounded the philosophy of trusteeship.This philosophy should be our guiding star. The austerity that Gandhiji practisedand preached is a necessary condition for accelerated economic development in theframework of a democratic polity. The trusteeship that he prescribed for the ownersof wealth captured the idea of social responsibility.\n",

            "to mindless and heartless consumerism we have borrowed from the affluent societiesof the West. My objection to the consumerist phenomenon is two-fold. First, wecannot afford it. In a society where we lack drinking water, education, health,shelter and other basic necessities, it would be tragic if our productive resourceswere to be devoted largely to the satisfaction of the needs of a small minority. Thecountry’s needs for water, for drinking and for irrigation, rural roads, good urbaninfrastructure, and massive investments in primary education and basic healthservices for the poor are so great as to effectively preclude encouragement toconsumerist behaviour imitative of advanced industrial societies. Our approach todevelopment has to combine efficiency with austerity. Austerity not in the sense ofnegation of life or a dry, arid creed that casts a baleful eye on joy and laughter. Tomy mind, austerity is a way of holding our society together in pursuit of the noblegoal of banishing poverty, hunger and disease from this ancient land of ours.\n",

In the medium-term, however, ourfiscal regime would be sustainable only if revenue receipts not only meet revenueexpenditure but also provide a sufficient surplus to finance capital expenditurethat does not yield direct economic returns as such, as in defence or in socialsectors. Even this would not suffice if investment expenditures in the budget donot earn an adequate return.

I had indicatedin Parliament that this should be considered only when the balance of paymentssituation improves, and adequate confidence has been built in the capacity of theGovernment to manage the economy. This has now been achieved. Our reservesare large and do not need supplementing, but I see no reason why patriotic citizensshould be denied the opportunity to contribute their mite to the development ofIndia’s economy. I propose to introduce a scheme under which citizens can obtaina Gold Bond in return for gold. The bond would be for a period of five to sevenyears and would be liquidated by return of gold, or equivalent value, at the optionof the holder. It would enjoy a small interest, which will not attract income-tax. Thebonds will also be free of wealth tax and gift tax. As an added incentive, holders ofsuch bonds will not be asked any questions about the source of the gold holding.The Reserve Bank of India is preparing a detailed proposal along these lines.\n",

I agree with this assessment andI propose to restructure the personal income tax in the following manner. I proposeto enhance the exemption limit for income tax levy from Rs.22,000 at present toRs.28,000.
