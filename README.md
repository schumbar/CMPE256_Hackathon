## Query and Responses

Please see below for a list of queries that we used to test our model, along with the responses that we received from the model. The queries are grouped by the persona that we used to test the model.

### Persona: Government Representative

#### Query: Is India self sufficient in terms of foodgrains?

Response: Based on the given context, India is not self-sufficient in terms of foodgrains. The country has been heavily reliant on importing foodgrains from abroad, which puts a strain on the government's finances. The government has been implementing policies and campaigns to increase food production and reduce the need for imports, but the results have been disappointing. The food position in the country is still a source of anxiety, and there is a constant need to control the distribution of available supply and impose restrictions on the import of other essential articles.

#### Query: Has revenue expenditure increased for India in the years provided, if yes then how?

Response: Based on the provided context, it can be inferred that the revenue expenditure has increased in the years mentioned. In the first set of context, it is mentioned that the total expenditure for the year is estimated to be higher than the budget estimate, and the net deficit on revenue account is expected to be higher as well. In the second set of context, it is mentioned that the expenditure adjustment constitutes the core of the proposed fiscal correction for the current financial year. Additionally, it is stated that the revenue from direct taxes has registered a steady decline over time. However, the exact details of how revenue expenditure has increased in each specific year are not provided.

#### Query: Has the policy of foreign restriction worked for India in the years provided?

Response: Based on the given context, it is difficult to determine whether the policy of foreign restriction has worked for India in the years provided. The context mentions that the government has introduced changes in import-export policy aimed at reducing import licensing and promoting exports. It also mentions that the Reserve Bank of India has liberalized procedures for Indian companies with foreign equity and non-resident Indians returning to India. However, there is no specific information on the outcomes or impacts of these policies on India's economy or industrial development.

#### Query: Was there a gain in revenue from corporate tax during and after 1990, if yes then how much more than the previous quarter?

Response: According to the given context, there was a gain in revenue from corporate tax during the specified period. The context states that there was a gain in revenue from corporate tax to the extent of Rs.800 crores. However, it does not provide information on the comparison with the previous quarter or period.

#### Query: What has been the trend of the import duty rates during each quarter for the data provided

Response: The provided context does not mention the specific import duty rates during each quarter. Therefore, I don't have the information to answer your question.

#### Query: Is India successful in reducing the fiscal deficit in order to restore macro-economic balance in the economy, if yes then how

Response: Yes, India was successful in reducing the fiscal deficit in order to restore macro-economic balance in the economy. The text mentions that the fiscal deficit was reduced from about 8.4% of GDP in 1990-91 to around 6.5% in 1991-92. This reduction was made possible by enforcing strict discipline on the expenditure side and implementing measures such as reducing the price increase of fertilizers. The government also sought to progressively reduce the fiscal deficit of the Central Government over the medium-term. However, it is important to note that this process would take at least three years, if not longer, to complete.

#### Query: Was there an increase in India's International Monetary Fund quota?

Response: Based on the given pieces of context, there is no mention of an increase in India's International Monetary Fund (IMF) quota. Therefore, it is unclear whether there was an increase or not.

#### Query: Has there been an overall improvement in India's foreign exchange position?

Response: Yes, there has been an overall improvement in India's foreign exchange position. The government has successfully rebuilt the foreign exchange reserves to about Rs. 11,000 crores and has concluded arrangements with multi-lateral financing institutions such as the IMF, the World Bank, and the Asian Development Bank to obtain quick disbursing funds to support the balance of payments. However, the pressure on reserves continues due to the increase in debt-service obligations.

#### Query: Is India successful in exporting Domestic electronic goods?

Response: The provided context does not directly mention the success of India in exporting domestic electronic goods. Therefore, I don't have enough information to answer this question.

#### Query: Has India taken any measure to improve agricultural infrastructure? How will it affect the customers?

Response: Yes, India has taken measures to improve agricultural infrastructure. The government has proposed the Agriculture Infrastructure Fund, which will be made available to Agricultural Produce Market Committees (APMCs) to augment their infrastructure facilities. This fund will help in the development of modern fishing harbours and fish landing centres. Additionally, the government plans to develop inland fishing harbours and fish-landing centres along rivers and waterways.
These measures will have a positive impact on customers. Improved agricultural infrastructure will lead to increased productivity and efficiency in the agricultural sector. This can result in a higher supply of agricultural products, leading to stable prices and availability for customers. The development of fishing harbours and landing centres will also enhance the fishing industry, ensuring a steady supply of seafood for customers. Overall, these measures aim to create a better agricultural ecosystem, benefiting both farmers and customers.

### Persona: Economics Researcher

However, there are mentions of efforts to restore macro-economic balance, reduce fiscal deficit, implement structural reforms, improve productivity and competitiveness, and promote growth and employment.

6. Credibility restoration: The government successfully restored India's credibility, which helped in rebuilding foreign exchange reserves and attracting investments.
7. Support from multilateral financing institutions: India obtained quick disbursing funds from international institutions like the IMF, World Bank, and Asian Development Bank. This support helped in managing the balance of payments.
8. Focus on reducing inflation: The government prioritized reducing inflation, as it had a significant impact on the poor and fixed-income earners. Efforts were made to control inflation and maintain price stability.
9. Emphasis on equitable growth: The government aimed to achieve a pattern of production that was labor-intensive and generated more employment opportunities. The objective was to reduce income and wealth disparities between rural and urban areas.
10. Opportunities for growth: The economic conditions at the time provided opportunities for growth, and the government emphasized the need for adequate developmental outlays to seize these opportunities.
It is important to note that these factors contributed to the economic sustainability of India post-1991, but the process of reforms and sustainable growth is ongoing and requires continuous efforts.

#### Query: Did India achieve Social Sustainability after 1987?

Response: Based on the given context, it is mentioned that India has achieved considerable success in the field of development, modernization, and greater social equity.

These measures were part of the implementation of the 4 labor codes and aimed at providing social security and protection to workers.

Response: India has made efforts to achieve rural development post-1947. The provided context mentions various measures and initiatives taken by the government to support agriculture and rural development, such as increasing the budgetary support for the rural sector, providing debt relief and fertilizer subsidies, and emphasizing employment programs.

The budget also included provisions for schemes that create more jobs, generate self-employment opportunities, and strengthen agriculture, which is seen as a sure route to overcome poverty. Specifically, there were significant increases in the amount paid to farmers for various crops. For example, the amount paid to wheat-growing farmers increased from 33,874 crores in 2013-2014 to 75,060 crores in 2020-2021. Similarly, the amount paid to paddy farmers increased from 63,928 crores in 2013-2014 to an estimated 172,752 crores in 2020-2021.
